The Idea: Online personalized shopping experiences for men

Overview:
The site prompts new members to take a quick quiz to discover their personal style profile
and then star shopping base on that initial profile. Over time, the recommendation algorithm gets
more sophisticated as it takes into account the members’ prior purchases as well. As a result each
member receives a selections that they feel have been handpicked just for them.

Goal for final project:
I would like to create the initial landing page and data gathering process to help personalize each
shopper’s selections.
